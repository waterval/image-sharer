# Image Sharing Platform for optical illusions

Image Sharing Platform enables users to upload their favorite images featuring optical illusions. A user can provide these images with their username, a title and a description. After a successful upload, the corresponding image shows up instantly in the image overview. After clicking on an image, itâ€™s possible to view the provided information and add comments. Besides that an image can be deleted and will immediately get removed from the platform.
